# Implementation Plan for `graph.ts`

## 1. Define TypeScript Types

**Objective:** Create interfaces for Node and Graph, making the graph generic to support different data types.

**Steps:**
- Define a `Node` interface with properties for ID, inputs, and outputs.
- Define a `Graph` interface that is generic and contains methods for adding nodes and connecting them.

## 2. Implement Multiple Inputs

**Objective:** Design nodes to accept multiple named inputs, ensuring each input is clearly identified by name.

**Steps:**
- Modify the `Node` interface to include a map of named inputs.
- Implement methods in the graph to connect nodes via these named inputs.

## 3. Assign Unique IDs

**Objective:** Generate a unique ID for every node created in the graph.

**Steps:**
- Create a utility function to generate unique IDs.
- Ensure each node gets a unique ID upon creation.

## 4. Create a Decorator Function

**Objective:** Develop a decorator that wraps regular functions with a graph node, adding a generated ID to each wrapped function/node.

**Steps:**
- Implement a decorator function that takes a function and returns a new function wrapped in a node.
- Add the unique ID generation to this decorator.

## 5. Implement Core Functionality

**Objective:** Develop methods for connecting nodes via named inputs and provide utilities for creating and managing graphs programmatically.

**Steps:**
- Implement connection methods in the graph class.
- Create utility functions for common graph operations.

## 6. Testing and Validation

**Objective:** Write unit tests to validate graph creation, node connections, ID generation, and decorator functionality.

**Steps:**
- Use a testing framework like Jest or Mocha.
- Write test cases for each feature: node creation, connection, ID generation, and decorator usage.

## 7. Documentation

**Objective:** Document all types, functions, and provide clear instructions on how to use the decorator function.

**Steps:**
- Add JSDoc comments to all interfaces, classes, and methods.
- Include usage examples in the documentation.
